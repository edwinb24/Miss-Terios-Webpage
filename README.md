# Miss-Terios-Webpage
Consists of:
This project is a webpage designed for the Miss Terios boutique in Panama. I worked for approximately two years for them creating and maintaining this web page, an appointment system using Appointy, and some graphic design for their promotions and events. The page was created in around 5 months, and for the other year and a half I was managing the site and creating other content for them. We communicated 2 to 3 times a week through Skype, Whatsapp, e-mails, and phone calls.
To see this functioning version go to www.edwinb24.com/missterios
Notes:
I was unable to find the final functioning version of the Webpage, but this version is very close to the finished page. The web page consisted of a one page design in which the screen scrolled to different parts of the website to show the content instead of directing you to a different link.  
Tools: HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, PHP, Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Fireworks, Mozilla Firefox
Technical:
• The pictures were provided by Miss Terios; all effects used in backgrounds and images were designed using Adobe Fireworks CS6
• The website presents the following features:
 - The capacity for clients to contact the beauty salon through the website using a PHP contact page, which sends an e-mail to miss-terios.
 - Scroll to function to go the different pages of the site
 - A photo gallery which allows the user to see pictures of events in the beauty salon and a link to the Facebook page of the beauty salon
 - An Accordion, which is used to introduce the employees of the beauty salon to clients with their background
 - Emerging images that are utilized to show the images in the gallery in large scale and to show the menu of the cafe
 - A personalized scrolling bar through the whole site
 - HTML5 and CSS3 effects, such as shadows in boxes and special effects when a link is hovered on by the cursor
 - Lines of codes to adapt to different web browsers (especially IE9)
